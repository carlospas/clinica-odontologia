        medical tourism.Our clinic is located <strong>just two blocks from the border crossing</strong>, in a tourist
        area safe for walking. Is a very big difference compared to other border or big cities in comfort, attention
        and security especially. Attached you will find a map with directions to our facilities. If
        you wish, you can call us and <strong>a member of our staff will meet you at the border to direct you
        to our clinic</strong>. Please note that the proximity to the United States is a geographic advantage as
        well, that force us to meet high standards of safety, quality, English fluently, etc. Hard to
        find with other options.
